- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @Nicos65 more commonly called Nicolas and I am a student From France in a university where I am doing a computer science license.
- ðŸ‘€ I am interested in video games, series and web development (front-end and back-end).
- ðŸŒ±I am currently learning several languages to be able to be complete even if for the moment I am learning the basics. 
     that's why you could see several projects in different languages.
- âœ¨ I would post all my projects in public to be able to have feedback and also to be able to help other people. let's not forget it is an exchange site ;D.
- ðŸ“« To reach me you can send me an email: Dubroca.nicolas0543@gmail.com.
